In this regard it acts much like Swarm to allow you to meet your friends and check in with them - all natively for your BB10 device.<br /><br />Code &amp; UI: Dirk Songuer (dirk@songuer.de).</html>";

I take great care that the application is as good as it can be, however I can't guarantee that it is bug-free and works flawlessly on every BlackBerry 10 device. If you encounter any problems, please feel free to contact me.<br /><br />Services are provided by Foursquare and I do not make any guarantees on their quality or performance.</html>";
var swirlAboutPrivacy = "<html>User privacy and anonymity are extremely important to me so this application does not retain any personal data about you. Your login is handled via oAuth by Foursquare directly, which means this application does not need to store nor use your personal data at any given time. Hence I can absolutely never disclose any personally identifiable information to outside parties since no private data is stored on your device or globally.</html>";
